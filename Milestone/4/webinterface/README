-F'[=&]'                   :   Sets the field separator to either = or &, effectively
                           splitting the string into fields based on these
                           delimiters, commonly used in URL query parameters.
{for(i=1; i<=NF; i++) ... }:   Iterates over all fields in the input string.
if ($i == "title")         :   Checks if the current field equals "title".
{print $(i+1); break}      :   If "title" is found, prints the next field (which is the
                           value of "title") and then exits the loop (for
                           efficiency).
