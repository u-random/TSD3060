Introduction to TSD3060 Web Server....



COMPILE the server with makefile: write "make" in terminal at TSD3060-Webserver-1 directory
CLEAN object files and program with "make clean"



START server from directory: (You need to use the path to your TSD3060-Webserver-1 directory where relevant)
./TSD3060 \
-d "complete path to directory"/dist/var/www \
-p "Portnumber (int)" \ #example: "55556"
-l "complete path to directory"/dist/var/log/debug.log \
-r "complete path to directory"/dist/var/run \
-i \ #if you want to run interactible (not daemonized)
start



Example from my case:
./TSD3060 \
-d /Users/isak/TSD/dist/var/www \
-p 55556 \
-l /Users/isak/TSD/dist/var/log/debug.log \
-r /Users/isak/TSD/dist/var/run \
start


// TODO: Server does no longer accept cmd^C as quit parameter, need to fix
STOP server from directory: (You only need pid file directory as a parameter here)
./TSD3060 \
-r /Users/isak/TSD/dist/var/run \
stop
