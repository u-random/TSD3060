Introduction to my TSD3060 Web Server

The project is on GitHub: https://github.com/u-random/TSD3060

Clone this project from GitHub:
    git clone https://github.com/u-random/TSD3060.git

The project provides a Makefile to build the binary.

COMPILE the server in the TSD3060 directory with:
    make
CLEAN object files and program with:
    make clean

The server assume and use a Distribution directory with the following required structure:

Distribution/
            var/
                log/
                www/
                run/
            etc/mime.types

The program takes the following arguments and options:
-r dir     Specify distribution root for the server
-p port    Port number for server
-i         Server runs non-daemonized
-v         Version information
-d         Write extra debug info
-h         Prints help text


START the server from directory:
./TSD3060 -r Distribution -p 55556 -i start


STOP server from directory: (You only need Distribution directory as an agrument here, because that is used as reference to the pid file, which is needed to stop the server in its daemonized state, as it has no shell connected.)
./TSD3060 -r Distribution stop

STOP server can also be done with ctrl+c in the shell if server is not daemonized.
