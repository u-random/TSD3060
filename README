Introduction to my TSD3060 Web Server

The project is on GitHub: https://github.com/u-random/TSD3060
Clone this project from GitHub:
    git clone https://github.com/u-random/TSD3060.git

The project provides a Makefile to build the binary.

COMPILE the server in the TSD3060 directory with:
    make
CLEAN object files and program with:
    make clean

The server assume and use a Distribution directory with the following required structure:

Distribution/
            var/
                log/
                www/
                run/
            etc/mime.types

The program takes the following arguments and options:
-d dir     Specify distribution root for the server
-p port    Port number for server
-i         Server runs non-daemonized
-h         This help text


START the server from directory: (You need to use the path to your TSD3060 directory where relevant)
./TSD3060 \
-d Distribution \
-p 55556 \
-i \
start


STOP server from directory: (You only need pid file directory as a parameter here)
./TSD3060 -d Distribution stop

// TODO: Server does no longer accept cmd^C as quit parameter, need to fix
