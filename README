Welcome to my TSD3060 Web Server!

Clone this project from GitHub with:
    git clone https://github.com/u-random/TSD3060.git

This project provides a Makefile to build the binary.

COMPILE the server in the TSD3060 directory with:
    make
CLEAN object files and executable with:
    make clean

The server assume and use a Distribution directory with the following required structure:

Distribution/
            var/
                log/
                www/
                run/
            etc/mime.types


The program takes the following arguments and options:
-r dir      Specify distribution root for the server
-p port     Port number for server
-i          Server runs non-daemonized
-v          Version information
-d          Write extra debug info
-h          Prints help text

start       default action
stop        To stop the server


START the server from TSD3060 directory:
./TSD3060 -r Distribution -p 55556 -i start


STOP the server from TSD3060 directory: (You only need Distribution directory as an agrument here, because that is used as reference to the pid file, which is needed to stop the server in its daemonized state, as it has no shell connected.)
./TSD3060 -r Distribution stop

STOP server can also be done with ctrl+c in the shell if server is not daemonized.
